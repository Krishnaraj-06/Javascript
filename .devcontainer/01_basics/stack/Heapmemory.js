//Stack Memory stores all Primitive datatypes in it.
//Why?
/*
Primitives DT are super quick and light
*/
//Where as, Reference DT are stored in Heap Memory
/*
Objects are bigger, mutable and need large space,
Reference is passed to other variable unlike copies in stack,
any change in reference will change the original data too
